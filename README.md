Straighten Up!
==============

This is a prototype for an app created during the lecture Designing Interactive Systems 1 at RWTH Aachen.

It's based on [harpjs](http://harpjs.com) and [jquery mobile](http://jquerymobile.com).

## How to use

Either download the compiled version or install harpjs (see link above), clone the repository and run `harp server`.

### Notes to the compiled version

The compiled version uses plain html. The links are absolute to a server's root (e.g. `/index.html`), so be sure to place them in a server environment.
